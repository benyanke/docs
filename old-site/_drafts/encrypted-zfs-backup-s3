This guide will detail how to backup a ZFS pool or dataset to an s3-compatible
file storage system

TODO: 
  * Research/test zfs send/receive locally on LAN for testing
  * Research/Test remote (s3) send-receive plaintext
  * Research piping through encryption / decryption
  * Research/test incremental runs in addition to the primary snapshots
    * Also test recovery time of fetching all those snapshots, vs when to start fresh

Tools to look at:
  * Z3
  * rclone
  * syncoid
  * duplicity
