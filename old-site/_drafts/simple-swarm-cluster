Docker Swarm Cluster with Ansible

[link to ansible basics]


## What is Docker Swarm

Docker Swarm is the built-in orchestration tool provided by the Docker Developers. It
provides a simpler interface than a full featured Kubernetes install, which brings much
more complexity with it.

Docker Swarm is built into the docker daemon, and does not require software addons.
