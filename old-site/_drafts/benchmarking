title: Simple Disk Benchmarks

There are a number of benchmarking tools available to benchmark linux disks.

## hdparm

This can benchmark the read speed on a disk even if it's not partitioned, 
being used in a ZFS pool, or otherwise not mounted as a filesystem.

```
$ sudo hdparm -t /dev/sdX
```


## dd

dd is a simple tool which reads and writes various data.

Below is a simple script which reads and writes to a test file on a 
filesystem you'd like to test.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Don't start if the file already exists - you don't want to
# overwrite an existing file

testfile="/tank/tmp/testfile"

ls "$testfile" &> /dev/null && exit 1

echo ""
echo "Testing writes"
echo ""
dd if=/dev/urandom of="$testfile" bs=100M count=20 iflag=fullblock
echo ""
dd count=1k bs=1M if=/dev/urandom of="$testfile"

echo ""
echo "Testing Reads"
echo ""
dd of=/dev/null if="$testfile" bs=100M count=20 iflag=fullblock
echo ""
dd count=1k bs=1M of=/dev/null if="$testfile"

rm "$testfile"
```




Another tool:

generate.sh:
for i in $(seq 1 $NUMBER); do dd if=/dev/urandom of=$TARGET/file_$i bs=$SIZE count=$COUNT 2>&1 | grep -v records done

Uses:
#### Creating 10240 files of 100k 
export NUMBER=10240 export TARGET=`pwd`/100k export SIZE=100K sh generate.sh > 100k.log   

#### Creating 1024 files of 1M 
export NUMBER=1024 export TARGET=`pwd`/1M export SIZE=1M sh generate.sh > 1M.log   

#### Creating 100 files of 10M 
export NUMBER=100 export TARGET=`pwd`/10M export SIZE=10M sh generate.sh > 10M.log   

#### Creating 10 files of 100M 
export NUMBER=10 export COUNT=100 export TARGET=`pwd`/100M export SIZE=1M sh generate.sh > 100M.log   

#### Creating 1 file of 1G 
export NUMBER=1 export TARGET=`pwd`/1G export SIZE=1M export COUNT=1024 sh generate.sh > 1G.log
