Title: Setting up Pass


`pass`, the standard unix password manager, is a simple shell script that 
provides an interface to easily store and access files encrypted with 
GPG, in a secure password vault.

`pass` uses `gpg` (an implementation of the pgp encryption protocol) to 
encrypt and decrypt your files, so you can access them with any tool 
which decrypts with your GPG keys, not just the `pass` tool. You can sync 
the password vault using any tool, or you can use git, which is 
integrated with `pass`, to provide automatic syncing between devices.

There are several other tools you can use to manage your pass database:

  * [qtpass](https://qtpass.org) - a desktop gui pass tool providing full 
    GUI management of the vault
  * [gopass](https://github.com/gopasspw/gopass) - a replacement for 
    `pass` with some additional features like search and coloring
  * `gpg` - you can directly decrypt your password files using `gpg`, 
    without any wrapper. This can be useful for building your own scripts 
    or tooling.


## Setting up your GPG key

First, you need to create your GPG key. You can skip this step if you 
already have a GPG key you would like to use.

First, generate your key:

```
$ gpg --gen-key
```

You will see a number of options. Generally, they are clear on 
their own, but here are the options you should check that may not be clear:

  * Select "DSA and RSA" key type
  * Create a 4096 bit key
  * Expiration - generally set to 0 (none) if you're not sure. Read 
    more below.

You'll then enter your name, email, password, and allow the key to 
generate. After you enter the password, it may take a while. Once 
the entropy is generated, the key generation is complete. The 
password must be secure, it is embedded in your key, used to 
encrypt it.

Finally, your key is stored in ~/.gnupg.

 - pinentry-program /usr/bin/pinentry-curses
  - OR:
 - pinentry-program /usr/bin/pinentry-qt


TODO: Document expiration selection. TLDR: if you don't know what 
you're doing, never expire.

## Setting up `pass`

Now that you have a key, either an older key, or one generated above, you can set up your pass vault.

First, list your keys using the gpg command:
```
$ gpg --list-secret-keys
/home/johndoen/.gnupg/secring.gpg
----------------------------------
sec   4096R/12345678 2018-11-02
uid                  John Doe (Comment) <jdoe@example.com>
ssb   4096R/12345678 2018-11-02
```

Your key is identified by the email (in this case, 
jdoe@example.com). Use this identifer to create your pass database, 
adding the key identifier to the end of the command.

```
$ pass init jdoe@example.com
mkdir: created directory '/home/johndoe/.password-store/'
Password store initialized for jdoe@example.com
```

Your password store has now been created at the path shown in the 
command output. You can now back up this directory, or sync it 
around, if you don't use the git option.

## Using `pass`

Passwords in `pass` are stored in a directory-like tree.

## Using `gopass`

As discussed above, gopass is an alternative which can be used to 
access the database. 

If you have the golang toolchain installed, you can simply install by running:

```
$ go get github.com/gopasspw/gopass
```
