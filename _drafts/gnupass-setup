Title: Setting up Pass


`pass`, the standard unix password manager, is a simple shell script that 
provides an interface to easily store and access files encrypted with 
GPG, in a secure password vault.

`pass` uses `gpg` (an implementation of the pgp encryption protocol) to 
encrypt and decrypt your files, so you can access them with any tool 
which decrypts with your GPG keys, not just the `pass` tool. You can sync 
the password vault using any tool, or you can use git, which is 
integrated with `pass`, to provide automatic syncing between devices.

There are several other tools you can use to manage your pass database:

  * [qtpass](https://qtpass.org) - a desktop gui pass tool providing full 
    GUI management of the vault
  * [gopass](https://github.com/gopasspw/gopass) - a replacement for 
    `pass` with some additional features like search and coloring
  * `gpg` - you can directly decrypt your password files using `gpg`, 
    without any wrapper. This can be useful for building your own scripts 
    or tooling.


## Setting up your GPG key

First, you need to create your GPG key. You can skip this step if you 
already have a GPG key you would like to use.
