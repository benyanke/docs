On main node:

starting with centos7

## Basic CentOS Install

A few packages to install for general system administration. Installs wget, htop.

TODO: May add more here

The script below installs `wget`, adds the repo for expanded package lists, then installs
`htop` from that expanded package list.


```
sudo yum install -y wget screen &&
sudo wget dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/Packages/e/epel-release-7-11.noarch.rpm &&
sudo rpm -ihv epel-release-7-11.noarch.rpm &&
sudo rm epel-release-7-11.noarch.rpm &&
sudo yum install -y htop
```


## Read System Requirements

Give the [system requirements](https://ovirt.org/documentation/install-guide/chap-System_Requirements/)
guide a read, and ensure you have everything you need.

## OVirt Head Node Install

First, run updates to grab latest packages in the base OS.

```
sudo yum -y update
```

This may take several minutes. At times, there can be tens or hundreds of upgrades, depending on 
how long it has been since the install disk was generated.

Then, reboot the server to apply the latest versions.

Once the server comes back online, add the ovirt repository:

```
sudo yum install http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release42.rpm
```

If all succeeds, install ovirt:

```
sudo yum -y install ovirt-engine
```

There are about 300 sub-packages in the ovirt-engine package. Installation will take about 5-10m, 
depending on server speed.

Finally, once it is installed, begin setting up the node:

```
sudo engine-setup
```

When asked, set the default options (press enter without entering input) except
on the following options

 * bypass minimum memory warning (if in testing, not for production obviously)
 * set an ovirt root password


Then go, in a web browser, to the address provided at the end of the setup,
and login using `admin` / `your password provided above`.


## Installing Host Node

There are two types of worker nodes: *Thin Hosts* and *Thick Hosts*. Thin hosts are installed 
from an OVirt iso image, and while based on CentOS, only contain the needed packages to run 
Virtual Machines, and are optimized for this. Thick hosts are full CentOS or RHEL installs, with 
the OVirt packages installed. Generally, thick hosts are used if you need to heavily customize 
your worker nodes, and otherwise thin hosts are the best way to provision hosts.

This guide will document the install of *Thin Hosts* from the OVirt site.

First, fetch the latest ISO from (the OVirt download paage)[https://ovirt.org/node/]. Ensure you 
verify the hashes of the ISOs before writing them to a USB stick. TODO: Find these hashes.As 
documented on the page linked above, generally the node is installed, and then `yum update` is 
run to update to future minor-versions.

Write the ISO to a USB stick using the normal methods. Boot from the USB and go through the 
install steps. Install using default settings, adjusting where needed to set things like hostname 
or host IP address. Use the Automatic Partitioning if possible.

When the install is complete, you will add your new host to the OVirt cluster. The following 
section was borrowed from the [add 
host](https://ovirt.org/documentation/install-guide/chap-Adding_a_Host_to_the_oVirt_Engine/) 
guide from the OVirt manuals.

You will also want to set the host's hostname (maybe this should be done during install?). Run 
the following commands to edit the hostname files. In `hosts`, add the hostname to the end of 
both lines. In hostname, remove what is there and replace with your FQDN. This must be done in 
`vi`, as the nodes do not have - by default - nano or other text editors.

When you're done, reboot to apply new hostname.
TODO: it's possible to do this without rebootting, but not sure how on CENTOS7.

```
sudo vi /etc/hosts
sudo vi /etc/hostname
sudo reboot
```

Finally, set the static ip if `ip addr` does not list a bound IP (which can occur if you don't 
have DHCP on your subnet).

To set a static ip, first find the interface (usually starting with `en` but depends per system), and open up 
the interface config file for that interface:

```
sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-[INTERFACE NAME]
```

This may be already configured.

Finally, bring the interface up:

```
sudo ifup [interface name]
```

Then check to ensure that the interface has it's IP:

```
ip addr
```

TODO: Research how to make this automatic. It's gotta be done on each boot for now.


    From the Administration Portal, click Compute â†’ Hosts.

    Click New.

    Use the drop-down list to select the Data Center and Host Cluster for the new host.

    Enter the Name and the Hostname of the new host. The standard SSH port, port 22, is auto-filled in the SSH Port field.

    Select an authentication method to use for the Engine to access the host.

        Enter the root user's password to use password authentication - DON'T USE OUTSIDE TESTING
        Alternatively, copy the key displayed in the SSH PublicKey field to /root/.ssh/authorized_keys on the host to use public key authentication.

    Click the Advanced Parameters button to expand the advanced host settings.

        Optionally disable automatic firewall configuration.

        Optionally add a host SSH fingerprint to increase security. You can add it manually, or fetch it automatically.

    Optionally configure power management, where the host has a supported power management card. For information on power management configuration, see "Host Power Management Settings Explained" in the Administration Guide.

    Click OK.

The new host displays in the list of hosts with a status of Installing, and you can view the progress of the installation in the details pane. After a brief delay the host status changes to Up


=====================


## Configuration of Datacenter

Once logged in, go to: Compute -> Data Centres.

You should see one default datacenter. Open it, and use the edit button to rename it. It should be a short 
letters, numbers, and hyphen string noting the physical location.

Returning to the DC list, you will likely see it's status as "uninitialized." This means all of it's 
dependent parts are not fully configured. To be initialized, the cluster, host, and storage domains must be 
configured first.

## Configure Cluster
Under Compute -> Cluster, rename the cluster to something appropriate. A cluster is a set of hosts. For most 
smaller installations, one production cluster is likely sufficent. You can edit it's name using the edit 
function if needed.
	

## Configure Storage

For our current test, we'll use gluster.

On the gluster node, add a password to root, and allow SSH root login via pw.

TODO: not for prod
TODO: DOCUMENT THIS

FOR NOW: Installing gluster on vm hosts

FOR NOW: Remote NFS server

On all hosts:
```
sudo yum install -y nfs-utils
```


## Head node Ldap

On the head node, install the package:
```
sudo yum install -yovirt-engine-extension-aaa-ldap-setup
```

Then, run the setup tool:

```
sudo ovirt-engine-extension-aaa-ldap-setup
```

You will be presented with LDAP server options. We will assume AD:

```
          Welcome to LDAP extension configuration program
          Available LDAP implementations:
           1 - 389ds
           2 - 389ds RFC-2307 Schema
           3 - Active Directory
           4 - IBM Security Directory Server
           5 - IBM Security Directory Server RFC-2307 Schema

          14 - iPlanet
          Please select: 
```

Select 3 for AD.

When asked the forest name, this is the domain name (EXAMPLE.COM).

Next, it will ask for `search user DN`. This is the bind DN. Load it with the bind credentials.

Beyond this, select defaults.

You will be offered a field to test logins - do so, and if it succeeds, you are done.

Finally, reboot. When you log in, select your domain instead of "internal"

## Configure Host






## THINGS LEFT TO RESEARCH
 * Add worker nodes
 * LDAPS auth or at least other users (https://ovirt.org/documentation/admin-guide/chap-Users_and_Roles/)
 * Postgres Backup
 * Test Failure Modes
   * Network partition
   * Head node down
   * Head node rebuild
 * Research pieces involved
 * Adding / removing / node maintance
 * Gluster/Ceph
 * VM Image Handling
 * Certificates



## Debugging on nodes:
  * Need interfaces to come up automatically on boot.
    * using `ifup [name]` for now
  * If you can't attach storage domains due to hostID sanlock issue:
    * run `sudo service sanlock restart` on all worker nodes
