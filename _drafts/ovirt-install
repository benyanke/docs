On main node:

starting with centos7



First, run updates to grab latest packages in the base OS.

```
sudo yum -y update
```

This may take several minutes. At times, there can be tens or hundreds of upgrades, depending on how long it has been since the install disk was generated.

Then, reboot the server to apply the latest versions.

Once the server comes back online, add the ovirt repository:

```
sudo yum install http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release42.rpm
```

If all succeeds, install ovirt:

```
sudo yum -y install ovirt-engine
```

There are about 300 sub-packages in the ovirt-engine package. Installation will take about 5-10m, depending on server speed.

Finally, once it is installed, begin setting up the node:

```
sudo engine-setup
```

When asked, set the default options (press enter without entering input) except
on the following options

 * bypass minimum memory warning (if in testing, not for production obviously)
 * set an ovirt root password


Then go, in a web browser, to the address provided at the end of the setup,
and login using `admin` / `your password provided above`.


THINGS LEFT TODO:
 * Add worker nodes
