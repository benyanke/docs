ZFS is typically used for non-root volumes, but for many situations, it's fully supported for root 
volumes as well, allowing it to be used in many of the same ways that BSD uses it, running full system
snapshots, full system restores and sends via `zfs send`, transparent compession, and the other
many benefits of ZFS.

While it is possible to migrate an existing system to ZFS root, this guide assumes a clean install.

TODO : make this attribution cleaner.
Based on this guide: https://furneaux.ca/wiki/Ubuntu_ZFS_Root

## Start Live CD

Boot into a live environment with the installer image you wish to install.

Exit the installer, open a terminal.


## Find Disk Info
First, find the root device you wish to install on:

```
$ lsblk

NAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
loop0    7:0    0   1.6G  1 loop /rofs
loop1    7:1    0  87.9M  1 loop /snap/core/5662
loop2    7:2    0   236M  1 loop /snap/kde-frameworks-5/27
sda      8:0    0 233.8G  0 disk 
sdb      8:16   1  28.7G  0 disk /cdrom
├─sdb1   8:17   1   1.7G  0 part 
└─sdb2   8:18   1   2.3M  0 part
```

In the example above, your device is `/dev/sda`.

Next, map your logical device name to it's physical name:

```
$ ls -lha /dev/disk/by-id

total 0
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 160 Oct 29 16:56 .
drwxr-xr-x 7 root root 140 Oct 29 16:56 ..
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   9 Oct 29 16:56 ata-APPLE_SSD_SM0256G_S2Z5NY0J474795 -> ../../sda
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   9 Oct 29 16:41 usb-APPLE_SD_Card_Reader_000000000820-0:0 -> ../../sdc
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   9 Oct 29 16:41 usb-SanDisk_Ultra_4C530001110721100544-0:0 -> ../../sdb
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  10 Oct 29 16:41 usb-SanDisk_Ultra_4C530001110721100544-0:0-part1 -> ../../sdb1
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  10 Oct 29 16:41 usb-SanDisk_Ultra_4C530001110721100544-0:0-part2 -> ../../sdb2
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   9 Oct 29 16:56 wwn-0x5002538900000000 -> ../../sda
```

Find the device name on the left side which points to your device found above. For us, it is
`ata-WDC_WDS500G1B0A-00H9H0_170703801742`, which points to `/dev/sda/`.


## Begin Disk Prep

With the disk name found above, we will now setup the partitioning.

First, we'll create the GPT partition table of the device we found. Replace everything 
after `/by-id/` with your device name.


```
$ sudo sgdisk -o /dev/disk/by-id/ata-APPLE_SSD_SM0256G_S2Z5NY0J474795

Warning! Mismatched GPT and MBR partition! MBR partition 2, of type 0x83,
has no corresponding GPT partition! You may continue, but this condition
might cause data loss in the future!
The operation has completed successfully.
```

You may see an error about mismatched partitions and data loss - this is 
fine, as we are already deleting everything on the disk during install.

  TODO: check to ensure that last paragraph is actually true, and issues
        won't persist after install.
