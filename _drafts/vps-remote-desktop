Sometimes, it can be useful to set up a server as a remote-desktop 
instance. However, most server providers don't allow the default
setup of desktop versions of linux.

This guide will document how to take an Ubuntu Server install and
install a desktop environment and remote access tool.

First, ensure the packages are up to date:

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt -y dist-upgrade && sudo apt autoremove -y
```

Next, reboot the server to apply the new kernel version, if there 
were any upgrades.


We will now install the Mate desktop environment, a lightweight desktop 
well suited to remote access:

```
sudo apt install -y ubuntu-mate-desktop
```



Finally, install X2go, as documented HERE. TODO: add link




Alternatively, use the following user data script when you provision your 
VM, assuming your provider supports them:

TODO: TEST THIS
```
#!/bin/bash

apt update && 
apt -y dist-upgrade && 
apt autoremove -y &&
apt install ubuntu-mate-desktop -y &&
apt-add-repository ppa:x2go/stable -y &&
apt install -y x2goserver x2goserver-xsession &&
apt install -y x2gomatebindings
```


Finally, you can SSH into your server, or use x2go to remotely access it's desktop.
