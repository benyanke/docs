PFX files contain both the key and the certificate. To use on linux servers, you must extract 
these into distinct files.


First, extract reencrypt the key into it's own file.

```
$ openssl pkcs12 -in [certificate.pfx] -nocerts -out [keyfile-encrypted.key]
```

You will be requested a password for decryption, as well as asked a password twice during reencryption.


Next, extract the certificate into it's own file.

```
$ openssl pkcs12 -in [certificate.pfx] -clcerts -nokeys -out [certificate.crt]
```

Finally, you can optionally store the keyfile in a decrypted manner. Note that this can have 
security implications, as anyone who has access to the file now has full access to the key with no 
further protection. However, if the key remains encrypted, any service using it must request a 
password before it can start up. In many situations, such as a webserver which might reboot 
without user interaction, this can be unacceptable, and a decrypted key must be used.
