Note: this is no longer needed, it's covered by the capsman guide

## Basic Startup
Connect the access point to the POE injector. Connect the `power+data` end to the AP. Connect the `data` end to your existing network. It will get a DHCP address,
and after you check your DHCP server to check it's address, log into the device using it's IP in the browser. For example: http://192.168.1.24.
