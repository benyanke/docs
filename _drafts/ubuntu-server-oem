7## Why OEM?

Creating an "OEM Install" allows a user to create an image that can be installed
on many systems, which requests more information on the next boot up, or to use a 
VM base image that can be cloned any number of times. Windows admins may be familiar
with this process using the "sysprep" tool. The same can be done on linux by combining 
a few tools.

While Ubuntu desktop has a built-in OEM mode (guide available [here](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Ubuntu_OEM_Installer_Overview), Ubuntu Server does not, requiring you to
build your own.

## Base Install

Start by doing a standard ubuntu server install (we're using 18.04).

Use "ubuntu" as the username and password.

When the install is done, make any configuration changes you want added to the base 
image. For example:
 - package updates
 - package installs
 - modifications to configuration files 
 - cronjobs
 - modifications to /etc/skel


## Suggested scripts

TODO : 

 - Add partition expand script

something like this (NOTE: UNTESTED):

start=$(cat /sys/block/mmcblk0/mmcblk0p3/start)
end=$(($start+$(cat /sys/block/mmcblk0/mmcblk0p3/size)))
newend=$(($(cat /sys/block/mmcblk0/size)-8))

if [ "$newend" -gt "$end" ]
then
    parted -s /dev/mmcblk0 unit s resize 3 $start $newend
fi


## Prepare for OEM Configuration

When these changes are complete, and you're ready to creae your clean image, 
install package `oem-config`:

```bash
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y oem-config ;
```

Once installed, run the following command. This will setup the system to refresh
itself on the next boot.

```bash
$ sudo oem-config-prepare
```

Finally, once complete, shut the system down.

Your system is now ready to clone and boot clones.
