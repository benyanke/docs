VyOS is a linux-based CLI-only router distribution. It is designed to act as a router 
appliance, offering complex enterprise-grade routing and switching features to anyone
for free.

It is based on a modifed Debian base, so can run anywhere Debian would run. It is 
suitable for both physical installations - prefered for production uses - as well as 
virtual installs - good for testing and VM networking.

This guide will document the steps required to take a clean VyOS install and set up the 
basic functions required to use it as a router at the edge of a test or residential 
network, including NAT, port forwarding, DHCP client function for the external IP, DHCP 
server functions for internal networking. With these functions, you can replace any 
standard consumer edge router with a far more powerful device.

## User Accounts

You should have set a password during installation and setup for the `vyos` user.

You can also add additional users using the following two commands. The user 
is being created with the following details:

 * username: jsmith
 * Full name: John Smith
 * Password: mypassword


```
set system login user jsmith full-name "Johan Smith"
set system login user jsmith authentication plaintext-password mypassword
commit
```

Additionally, you can delete users (such as the default `vyos` user) by 
running the following command. Note that you can not delete the currently 
logged in user.

```
delete system login user [username]
commit
```
