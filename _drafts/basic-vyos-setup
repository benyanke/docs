VyOS is a linux-based CLI-only router distribution. It is designed to act as a router 
appliance, offering complex enterprise-grade routing and switching features to anyone
for free.

It is based on a modifed Debian base, so can run anywhere Debian would run. It is 
suitable for both physical installations - prefered for production uses - as well as 
virtual installs - good for testing and VM networking.

This guide will document the steps required to take a clean VyOS install and set up the 
basic functions required to use it as a router at the edge of a test or residential 
network, including NAT, port forwarding, DHCP client function for the external IP, DHCP 
server functions for internal networking. With these functions, you can replace any 
standard consumer edge router with a far more powerful device.
