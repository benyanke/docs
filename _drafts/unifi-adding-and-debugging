## Adoption commands

```
default creds: ubnt@ip
pw: ubnt

# Reset to factory settings
sudo syswrapper.sh restore-default

# Will reboot now

# NOTE: WHEN RUNNING CONTROLLER BEHIND TLS PROXY:

# Login again, and run (probably twice)
set-inform https://controller.example.com/inform
# OR on older APs:
set-inform https://controller.example.com:443/inform

By default, it uses http on port 8080, which will work as well.
set-inform http://controller.example.com:8080/inform

Alternatively, if you are listening on 8080, you can setup DNS record "unifi" to point to the controller.

# After adopting in the controller, it may go offline

# When it comes back, you may need to run set-inform again if it doesn't work. It will not be available
```
